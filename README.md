# sqs-lambda-processor
Simple driver for SqsToLambdaListener. Takes arguments and runs the listener

run pip install -r requirementst.txt to install dependencies 
(preferably after initializing a virtualenv of course)

Run python sqs-lambda-processor.py from the command line to get the arguments.

Region defaults to eu-west-1 since I'm the only one who will ever use this :)
